The Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF provides immediate and granular visibility across all layers of your infrastructure, containers,

* Immediately understand the impact of every release so you can take quick action when deployments go wrong 
* Automatically organize all infrastructure and application data into context rich dependency relationships so you can immediately get to the root cause of any issue
* Confidently deploy software faster with fewer performance and quality defects

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

**Provide any general or specific requirements, prerequisites, or dependencies here.

Instana Microservices Application Monitoring has the following requirements:

+ An Instana account 

+ Coordinates of the Instana backend and your Agent Key

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

Cloud Foundry operators are responsible for installing and updating agents. With BOSH it is best to use the Instana static agent, as such, rolling out of agent fixes requires Cloud Foundry operator action.
