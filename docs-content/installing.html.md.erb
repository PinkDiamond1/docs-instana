This topic describes how to install and configure Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF.

##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF

To install the **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, do the following:

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF**. 
This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF** tile.

5. The **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF** tile requires minimal configuration in the **Backend connection** menu:

  - **Endpoint host**: the DNS name of the Instana backend, e.g., `saas-us-west-2.instana.io`
  - **Endpoint port**: the port number on which the Instana backend listens; for the SaaS offering of Instana, the value is `443`, but it can be configured differently for on-premise Instana backend installations
  - **Agent key**: the secret used by the Instana agent to authenticate itself to the Instana backend

  The data required is readily available in the Instana dashboard, under **More** &gt; **Management Portal** &gt; **Install agent**.

6. Click **Save**.

7. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply changes** to install the **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF** tile.

8. The Instana agent is rolled out to the PCF foundation. 

After the changes have been rolled out, whenever a new Virtual Machine is created in the PCF foundation, for example by adding new tiles or creating new service instances, the Instana Agent is automatically added to it.

##<a id='updates'></a> Configuring automatic updates for the Instana Agents

The Instana tile is self-contained, meaning that it ships with a version of the Instana agent that has all sensors needed to monitor PCF, its services, and the
applications running on it. However, Instana regularly release agent updates providing new sensors as well as performance improvements. 

There are two options to get the newest version of the Instana agent in your foundation: 
- Install the [latest version](#installing-the-instana-agent-tile-in-opsmanager) of the **Instana Microservices Application Monitoring for PCF** tile
- Use the **Agent configuration** tab of the Instana tile, which allows you to [configure the automatic updates](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_configuration/
#agent-versioning-and-update-management) of the Instana agents via the Ops Manager.
